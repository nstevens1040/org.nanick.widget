Time and Temp Widget
====================
   - **Weather Data** is provided by [The Weather Company](https://developer.weather.com/)
      - A forecast for 30 minutes in the future is fetched when the widget is launched and then every 30 minutes after that.
   - **Time and Date Display** uses `TextClock`
   - **Reverse Geocoding** is done with `android.location.Geocoder`
   - **Tapping** the widget opens `com.google.android.deskclock`
